# SIT Presentation

## A short presentation about Packaging for DS students of SIT Academy, Zuerich

- Link to DataScience, how to follow a similar path for DS packages (pipelines, visulations, stats)
- problem identification at a hackathon in 2019 (check if students know, if yes skip, if no explain)
- why create a new library rather than contribute to an existing project? (UNIX and pure functions)
- define the scope (data loading, use-cases, conventions) (kanban - anti-collision)
- professional software developer and domain expert collaboration (useful)
- Test Driven Development and Documentation Driven Development (rst file not known, show examples - why you need it., show examples, jupyter notebook and VScode)
- we depend on Numpy
- OOP vs functional approaches (remember they're datascientists)
- github, readthedocs, pypi
- so now you're a maintainer?
